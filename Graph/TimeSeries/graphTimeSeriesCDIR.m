function [h xLabel yLabel] = graphTimeSeriesCDIR( ax, sample_data, var )
%GRAPHTIMESERIESCDIR Plots CDIR data (sea water direction) as a normal, single
%dimensional, time series line.
%
% Plots sea water direction data, by taking the median value at each depth, 
% and plots these median values as time series data.
%
% Inputs:
%   ax          - Parent axis.
%   sample_data - The data set.
%   var         - The variable to plot.
%
% Outputs:
%   h           - Handle to the line which was plotted.
%   xLabel      - X label to use
%   yLabel      - Y label to use
